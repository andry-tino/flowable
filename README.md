# flowable
A library to generate flowing HTML-based content.

The idea of this project is to create a simple [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) based language in order to create content layout baded on flows. The user can specify directions from one content block to another, the layout will be automatically generated by the engine.
